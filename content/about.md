## Hi, I'm Amit Lale

I'm a senior developer with two decades of experience building software, leading teams, and watching technology trends come and go. I've spent most of my career at Microsoft, which has given me a front-row seat to how the industry evolves—and how much of that evolution is signal versus noise.

## What This Blog Is About

**Signal Over Noise** exists because the technology industry has a hype problem. Every few years, we're told the next big thing will change everything. Sometimes it does. Usually it doesn't. After 20 years in this field, I've developed a decent filter for separating genuine innovation from marketing narratives.

This blog is where I share:

- **Technical perspectives** grounded in real-world experience
- **Honest takes** on emerging technologies like AI, cloud, and development practices
- **Practical insights** from building software at scale
- **Work-life observations** from navigating two decades in tech
- **How-tos and knowledge sharing** on development, architecture, and engineering leadership

## My Approach

I'm not interested in breathless coverage of the latest framework or tool. I'm interested in what actually works, what the tradeoffs are, and what lessons we can extract from both successes and failures.

When I write about AI, I'm thinking about implementation challenges, not just capabilities. When I discuss development practices, I'm drawing from projects that shipped—and projects that didn't. When I share opinions, they're informed by having seen enough cycles to know what tends to last and what fades.

## Why "Signal Over Noise"?

The name reflects my editorial philosophy: cutting through the hype to focus on what matters. Technology moves fast, but fundamental principles evolve slowly. Understanding the difference between the two is what separates effective engineers from those constantly chasing trends.

After 20 years, I've learned that the most valuable insights often come from pattern recognition across projects, technologies, and teams. That's the signal. Everything else is noise.

## Beyond the Blog

When I'm not writing code or blog posts, I'm exploring photography—another pursuit where technology meets craft. You'll eventually find my photography work at [photo.amitlale.dev](https://photo.amitlale.dev).

## Get in Touch

Have thoughts on something I've written? Disagree with a take? Want to discuss a topic in depth? I'm always interested in thoughtful conversations about technology and its impact.
